#Command Line Parser

This is a simple command line parser library written in C++

It could probably do with more work but it should work pretty well as it is

##Compiling as a shared library

Simply run cmake and make (or ninja or whatever you want to use)

First make a build directory in the project root directory and enter that, then:

```bash
cmake ..
make
```
